Step 1: Unplug your iPhone, if it is already plugged in.


Step 2: Now, open a terminal and use the following command to install some necessary packages. Don’t worry if they are already installed.

sudo pacman -Sy ifuse usbmuxd libplist libimobiledevice --needed --noconfirm


Step 3: Once these programs and libraries are installed, reboot your system.

sudo reboot


Step 4: Make a directory where you want the iPhone to be mounted. I would suggest making a directory named iPhone in your home directory.

mkdir ~/iPhone/

Step 5: Unlock your phone and plug it in. If asked to trust the computer, allow it.


Step 6: Verify that iPhone is recognized by the system this time.

dmesg | grep -i iphone

This should show you some result with iPhone and Apple in it. Something like this:

[ 31.003392] ipheth 2-1:4.2: Apple iPhone USB Ethernet device attached
[ 40.950883] ipheth 2-1:4.2: Apple iPhone USB Ethernet now disconnected
[ 47.471897] ipheth 2-1:4.2: Apple iPhone USB Ethernet device attached
[ 82.967116] ipheth 2-1:4.2: Apple iPhone USB Ethernet now disconnected
[ 106.735932] ipheth 2-1:4.2: Apple iPhone USB Ethernet device attached


Step 7: When everything is set, it’s time to mount the iPhone. Use the command below:

ifuse ~/iPhone



Step 8: When you want to unmount it, you should use this command:

sudo umount ~/iPhone
